      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My objective is to enhance my company's growth and attract a larger customer base by effectively utilizing Google products such as Tag Manager, Ads, and Analytics.

        I need this website as a valuable tool to assist people and expand my client portfolio, ultimately broadening my potential market. To achieve this, my strategy involves two key steps:
        
        Initially, I aim to bolster my local business presence by leveraging my website and implementing targeted marketing campaigns using Google tools. This approach will enable me to establish a strong customer base within my state through efficient use of Google Tag Manager, Ads, and Analytics.
        
        Subsequently, I intend to reach out to potential clients beyond my state borders, leveraging the power of Google's advertising and analytical capabilities. This expansion effort will not only widen my business's reach but also attract more customers, contributing to its overall success.
        
        By harnessing the potential of Google products like Tag Manager, Ads, and Analytics, my business stands to benefit from increased visibility, a broader audience, and a growing customer base.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My ideal clients are those who are eager to explore and maximize the potential of Google advertising tools for their websites. When faced with intricate advertising challenges, they can readily access resources and support.

        My website is tailored to target customers falling within the 20 to 70 age bracket who possess the capacity to invest in online advertising. These users are eager to learn efficient techniques for utilizing Google advertising tools to boost their online presence and marketing efforts. In more complex advertising scenarios, they can turn to my expertise.
        
        Unfulfilled needs within this realm include advanced advertising strategies, personalized guidance, and effective tips for harnessing the full potential of Google advertising tools. These requirements will be comprehensively addressed through the strategic implementation of Google's Tag Manager, Ads, and Analytics, ensuring that users can navigate and leverage these tools effectively.
