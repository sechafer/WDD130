                <h4>What is Google Ads?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Google Ads, previously called Google AdWords, is Google's advertising platform. With it, you create campaigns to promote your company and stand out on search pages.

                                            The ads created can be published in different formats and channels, and not just on the Google search page — the so-called “search network ads”, which are based on the typing of keywords.
                                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        The other options are:

                            <li> display network: ads served on websites and blogs;</li>
                            <li>application ads: ads aimed especially at companies that have an app;</li>
                            <li>Youtube: advertisements published on this social network, at the beginning of the videos;</li>
                            <li>Google shopping: advertising aimed at those who sell products.</li>

                <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                <img src="images/google_analytics.png" alt="logo de google analitics" >
                <h4>What does Google Analytics consist of?</h4>
                <p>Google Analytics is a tool made available by Google that, when installed on your website/blog, allows you to monitor not only the number of people accessing your pages, but which ones are most visited, the origin of this traffic, the goals that were achieved , among many other data.

                    The objective is to monitor the behavior of people who visit your website and, therefore, make the necessary adjustments so that your company can achieve more and more conversions.
                    
                    For example, imagine you created a landing page to sell a new product. With Google Analytics you can identify whether visitors are actually reaching this page, how they are interacting with it, whether there are rejections, etc.
                    
                    With this information in hand, you can adjust your strategy so that it works correctly, that is, increases your sales</p>

                    Currently, when we talk about selling products, Google Shopping is the best solution.</p>
