              Hello! My name is Samuel Chacon and I am from Caracas, Venezuela but I am living in São Paulo, Brazil.
              I am an Electrical Engineer, and I hope soon also a software developer too!. I keep trying to learn and improve everyday.
              I currently work for a transnational company called cognizant where my role is to help clients install Google products such as Analitycs and Google Ads. 
              I am married since 14 years ago, and both are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
            </p>
