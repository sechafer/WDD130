            <Article class="question"><h3>What is included in the trip?</h3>
            <p> 
                We will provide you with all the essential camping equipment such as a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffel bag, compact waterproof day bag, tent, cot, eating utensils and camping chair . Throughout the day, we offer water and lemonade, while in the morning and at night we offer coffee, tea and hot chocolate. You cannot bring alcoholic beverages as we require that all your senses be alert.
                These items can be purchased the night before the trip or on the way to the starting point. We ensure three meals a day, along with snacks.

            <Article class="question"><h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
            <p>
                Like all adventure sports, there is an inherent and acknowledged risk involved. To prioritize your safety, 
                our guides are certified in wilderness first aid and possess a minimum of 3 years of rafting experience. 
                The most frequent injuries tend to be sunburn and those that happen on dry land. All participants on 
                our commercial rafting trips are required to wear a life jacket or a Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device (PFD). 
                Many non-swimmers enjoy rafting without any issues, but for those seeking added confidence, we collaborate with accommodating
                companies offering a one-week super-intensive swimming course.

            <Article class="question"><h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
            <p>
                This trip is suitable for children of all ages, but children over the age of 10 tend to enjoy it more overall. Parents also 
                enjoy it more if their children are over 10. A common concern parents have is that their children will be bored if they are stuck 
                on a boat for hours at a time. However, we are surprised at how few bored children we see, regardless of age.

            <Article class="question"><h3>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Imagine a typical day on the river. You wake up to the soft morning light after a night sleeping under the stars. You enjoy a hearty, hot breakfast, 
                        then pack your things and prepare for the day ahead. The day is filled with a variety of activities, including whitewater rafting, hiking, 
                        learning about history and geology, listening to stories, and, of course, eating more delicious food. Around 4 or 5 pm, you arrive at camp. 
                        After setting up your cot, you can relax and enjoy a good book or the company of your fellow rafters by the river, or explore the surrounding area while your guides prepare dinner.
