        <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Task: Create a web page using HTML that has a short biography and picture.</li>
          <li>Purpose: Introduce the students to HTML and each other. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
        <p>
          This week we have two important goals. One to introduce you to HTML, and two to introduce you to each other. With this activity we will accomplish both. Make sure to read the instructions and their explanations carefully.
        </p>

            <h2>Our first HTML</h2>
            <p>
              Let's write some HTML. Open VSCode, and make sure you are on the Explorer icon so you can see your folders and files. The files and folders might look like this: 
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="Explorer files images"
                  src="../images/explorer_files.png"
                  title="Explorer files"
                />
                <figcaption>File Management</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>We will only be using the index.html file and placing one image inside the images folder for this activity. In future activities, we will have a similar file management structure and will have files in other folders. But only index.html and the one image will be used this week.</p>
            <p>
              This code contains everything you need for a basic web page. It
              has tags, elements, nesting,
              parent elements, child elements, and semantics. Can you spot them
              all?
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  alt="About me code images"
                  src="../images/about-me-code.png"
                  title="Explorer files"
                />
                <figcaption>About Me index.html code</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>The title tag will show up as the name or tab of the window in the browser.</p>
            <p>Everything inside the body tags will show up on the web page.</p>
            <p>Each page should have one 'h1' tag with the main headline of the page. The 'h2' tags are sub-headings.</p>
            <p>Add the h1 and h2 tags with your information.</p>
            <p>Then write a paragraph or two to tell a little bit about yourself. Here is a list of ideas to talk about to get you
              started. You don't have to write about all of them.Remember that this will be a public website...so
              don't put anything too personal or identifying.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">

                  Do you have a current career/job... are you making a change by

                  The advantages you see from learning about careers in web
                  design, why you are taking the course, what you hope to get
                  out of it, and how you will use the information in your
                  personal or professional life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How long have you been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ
                  of Latter Day Saints?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite quote from
                  one of the leaders of the church?&nbsp; Do you have a favorite
                  scripture?

              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              Start with the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) that says "[Paragraph with information about you]".&nbsp; Replace that with your own information and wording. You don't need the '[ ]' square brackets. They are just there to show what text you will replace.
              Each time you want a new paragraph (please break it into more than
              one paragraph!) Add a new
              <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> element.

            <h2>View your work</h2>
            <p>
              When you have finished adding your paragraphs you will want to
              view your webpage. To do this right-click anywhere in the html file and from the pop-up menu choose 'Open with Live Server' and your default browser will render the html code and show your page as it would be seen on a browser.

            <h2>Add an image</h2>
            <p>
              Look's good, but it is a little plain.&nbsp;Let's add an image to
              dress up your page.
            </p>
            <p>Place an image of yourself inside the images folder.</p>
            <p>
              Put your image right after the &lt;h1&gt; line. You will start
              with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Images require additional
              information in order to work however. We have to tell the browser
              where to find the image. We can use an "attribute" for this. The attribute
              we need is <kbd>src=""</kbd>. Add this right after the word
              <kbd>img</kbd>. So it will look like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;img src=""&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              The name and path of your image will go into the "" after the
              <code>src</code>. Your file name will be whatever you named your image. The final tag should look something like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-markup html">&lt;img alt="Image of me?" src="images/myphoto.jpg" &gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Notice that I included an extra attribute:
              <strong> <kbd>alt</kbd> </strong>. The <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute
              should contain a short description of the image. It is shown if
              the browser can't find the image or it is read for visually
              impaired visitors to your site. <strong>All</strong> of your
              images should have an <kbd>alt</kbd> attribute. If a tag has
              multiple attributes, the order of the attributes does not matter.
            </p>

            <p>
              There, that looks great.... you coded a web page about yourself
              that is simple, informative, and has a touch of style.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your final page should look something like the pages below but
              with your information and your actual image.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
