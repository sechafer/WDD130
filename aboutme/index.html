    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>My name is Samuel Chacon</h2>
    <h2>My nick-name is Sammy or Samuelito or Sam</h2>
    <p>Currently, like many of you, I am starting a career in software development, I aspire to pursue an MBA at the Marriott Business School here at BYU.
        I am an Electrical engineer and I work as an outsourcer for Google installing javascript tags for products such as Google ads and Google analytics.
        I have always liked technology.
    </p>
    <p>I currently live in Brazil with my wife, in the state of Sao Paulo. I work for Cognizant, a technology services company that offers help to Google and provides support for the installation of product tags such as Google Ads, Google Analytics and Google Merchancenter. More than a year ago, specifically in March 2022, I introduced the revalidation process with the University of Sao Paulo, just a month ago and I was told that I would be recognized with my engineering title in Brazil if I approved the courses: power electronics 1 and the energy sustainability and environment course. Everything is perfect, what I didn't know is that in this close tenry of BYU IDAHO's commitments and my exams in the same month of September 2023 I put it to that time (March 2022) I hadn't thought about joining this university of BYU IDAHO , and the other challenge I have is that since June 2020, my wife has had an injury to her sciatic and lumbar nerve since June 2020, this injury has been kept in bed until it closes for so long all the tasks at home that I carry out and take to completeness, in the past it was easier to work remotely (due to the pandemic) now since this year I have been working in hybrid mode for 3 days at the Google workshops in Sao Paulo and two days at home, my house is two hours of my work Many times I have lost 5 hours of my life in car traffic. It has not been easier to be alone with my wife and I here in Brazil than our whole family is in Venezuela, but by chance we both passed BYU-Pathway where we met wonderful people and it has been one of the most satisfying experiences that we have had at the level of studio. And the other thing is that I am between my wife and I study the persecution of her difficulties due to chronic pain and the secondary effects that produce medications in her memory. In the end, I say, I will achieve her best effort even thoungth the difficulties we have facing faith in our heavenly Father, all difficulties we will overcome.  here my profile linkedin
